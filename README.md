# ResUNet-Semantic-Segmentation-of-remotely-sensed-image

In this project, the goal is to train a convolutional neural network with high accuracy for semantic segmentation of satellite remote sensing images. More specifically, satellite remote sensing imagery is classified into eight broad classes based on their land use categories: water, roads, buildings, agricultural arable land, grassland, gardens, woodland and background.
There are 1176 images in this dataset, and the size of each image is 1024 pixels high and 1024 pixels wide. The number of channels of the images is 3. The masks have been greyscaled beforehand and their pixel values are then equal to the ordinal number of the corresponding category.
